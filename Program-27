# Simulated RSA setup with large e and n (just illustrative here)
e = 65537
n = 99991  # In practice, n would be much larger

# Step 1: Build a ciphertext lookup table
rsa_dict = {}
for m in range(26):  # A-Z
    c = pow(m, e, n)
    rsa_dict[c] = m

# Suppose Alice encrypts "HELLO" as numbers: 7 4 11 11 14
plaintext = [7, 4, 11, 11, 14]
ciphertext = [pow(m, e, n) for m in plaintext]

# Step 2: Attacker decrypts using the lookup table
recovered = [rsa_dict[c] for c in ciphertext]
letters = [chr(num + ord('A')) for num in recovered]

print("Encrypted:", ciphertext)
print("Recovered numeric:", recovered)
print("Recovered text:", ''.join(letters))
